<p><b>General Ranching Concepts</b></p>

<ol>

<li> The Golden Rule for sustainable ranching is never taking more from the land than the land can sustain over time.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Grazing livestock on indigenous rangelands is deemed fully sustainable provided that the agricultural and ecological integrity of the land is preserved.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> In order to be sustainable, a ranching operation must be made financially viable, ecologically responsible, and socially acceptable.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Social values are often the underlying variable that hinders or encourages the development of a sustainable ranching system.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Degrading and subdividing large tracks of agriculturally and ecologically important rangeland poses the  greatest threat to the future of vocational ranching in Texas and other range states and regions.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Years of instability and low profitability in ranching leads to ranchers degrading and subdividing their grazing land in an attempt to recoup financial losses, pay off debt, or have enough money to live on after retirement.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Pride of independent ownership and management are major stumbling blocks that impede establishing a sustainable ranching enterprise.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Substituting tame pastures, purchased feed, and/or baled hay for native range forage is a quick way to becoming history in the ranching business.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Being a part owner of a large-scale, professionally managed, financially viable ranching enterprise is a far better option than being a full owner of a small-scale,  traditionally managed, unprofitable enterprise.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The hardest thing about the ranching business is achieving financial prosperity and happiness without degrading and ultimately destroying the ranch's soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife resources.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>   

<li> Most ranches in Texas and other range states and regions have been degraded and fragmented to the point were they no longer have enough animal unit grazing capacity to be financially viable on an one-operation, independent basis.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Operating a sustainable closed system ranching system requires having no less than approximately 500 head of breeding stock, and the EQUIVALENCE of no less than approximately 16,500 acres of mid-grass rangeland that's in good to excellent range condition.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Sustainable ranching on a small-scale sustainable basis requires local and regional producers working together according to a common method of livestock production and marketing.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Diversification plays an important role in making the ranching business profitable and sustainable.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> The method of diversification that offers ranchers an opportunity to improve the profitability of their operations with the least amount of financial outlay is contracting with a government or private organization to graze fewer livestock and grow more range forage for carbon sequestration and climate control purposes.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>


</ol>  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><b>Beef Cattle Concepts</b></p>
<ol>

<li> Functional cattle are bred and selected for their ability to convert foodstuff that non-ruminant animals (swine, poultry and fish) cannot convert more efficiently than ruminate bovines can.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The only reason for raising beef cattle is to convert native range forage into meat, leather, and valuable by-products for human consumption.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The ability of cattle to convert range forage efficiently can be lost by the excessive use of grain and the selection of cattle without ample middles.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Cattle that have the ability to convert range forage efficiently do not require a heavy investment in supplementary feed in order to stay in good body condition and be productive.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Most  beef cattle in the U.S. have lost the ability to convert range forage effectively without a heavy investment in supplementary feed.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Most cattle in the U.S. are bred to meet the needs of industrial agriculture (agricultural universities, commercial feed-yards, supply companies, etc.), not the needs of rangeland ranchers.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Most beef cattle in the U.S. are bred in open populations, and selected primarily on the basis of breed, breeding percentage, pedigree background, show-ring performance, color, size, growth, and/or milking ability.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Beef cattle bred in open populations are not predictable breeders and do not produce uniform quality offspring.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>  

<li> Cattle must be given additional protein and energy when the forage in their diet does not meet minimum nutritive requirements.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Highly productive cattle of any breed or cross do very poorly when moved to a lower elevation and a climate nearer the tropics (Alto Adams Jr.).<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Cattle do best when bred in the environment in which they are raised. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Any animal that seems to be accident or disease prone should be culled from the herd rather than receive a lot of individual attention. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Multi-sire breeding of best bulls to best cows within a closed population preserves the strength and soundness of a herd of cattle. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Longevity is an inherent trait and should be retained in cattle. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Improving productive longevity in a herd of cattle requires selecting bulls out of dams with the best udders and most proven track records.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Large herds allow for greater flexibility in bull selection. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Preventing close inbreeding in a herd of cattle requires changing sires before they have a chance to mate with their offspring, dams, or sisters.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Herd replacements should be selected out of good cows that calved on schedule without assistance (Alto Adams Jr.).<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> A surplus of heifers should be saved and exposed to bulls at an early age (Alto Adams Jr.).<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Heifers that breed first should be retained as cow replacements. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Maximizing calf-crop numbers at the lowest feasible cost requires scheduling each year's breeding season to coincide with time periods of peak forage quality.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Avoid the use of any breed or cross of cattle that have heavy birth weights, large frames, high milking ability, and maximum growth rates.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Best cattle for low-input ranching are moderate growth cattle with heavy muscling, low birth weights, small to medium body size, low to moderate milk, and dark pigmentation, and do not require large amounts of supplementary feed to be productive.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Best breed types for low-input ranching include but are not limited to purebred or crossbred Angus, Cracker, Yak, Dexter, Gyr, Hereford, Jersey, Kerry, Lowline, Muscles, Red Poll, and Shorthorn.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Best breeding plan for a sustainable ranch is using rigid, objective selection and closed population breeding to develop a distinct breed, strain, or bloodline of general-purpose cattle. <BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The fifteen most important traits in a herd of general-purpose range cattle are<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<ul>
<li> temperament
<li> early sexual maturity
<li> fertility
<li> calving ease
<li> bunching instinct
<li> herding ability
<li> predator protection
<li> mothering ability
<li> acceptable growth
<li> easy fleshing ability
<li> active libido in bulls
<li> hardiness
<li> production longevity
<li> visual appearance (conformation)
<li> carcass merit<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>   
</ul>  

<li> The key to developing highly prepotent cattle is rigid, objective trait selection within a closed breeding population.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Optimally adapted, general-purpose range cattle have the ability to produce top-quality acceptable slaughter animals and superior herd replacements while pasturing lightly stocked native range in a cost efficient manner.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> A simple breeding plan centered around mating best sons produced out of one breeding group (within a closed population) to best daughters produced out of another offers ranchers an opportunity to raise highly acceptable slaughter animals and superior herd replacements.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> It requires three or more generations of uninterrupted closed-herd breeding and rigid objective selection, following the protocol of a sound beef herd management plan, in order to develop a superior herd of general-purpose cattle.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Operating a closed-breeding system on a sustained basis requires maintaining a permanent gene pool of no less than approximately 500 head of adult breeders.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Large herd numbers offer greater genetic diversity, offer greater selection opportunities, and minimizes inbreeding problems in a closed population of cattle.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Three generations of culling inferior traits will eliminate most genetic problems in a herd of cattle unless the problems are reintroduced in the herd through outside bulls. (Alto Adams, Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Genetic improvement created by mating cattle within a closed population is measurable, cumulative and permanent, and can be sustained over an infinite period of time. (Alto Adams Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Lack of the right kind of replacements that will allow culling a herd properly is a serious problem and a major factor affecting the rapidity of developing a  superior herd of general-purpose cattle. (Alto Adams, Jr.)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The exact amount of time required to develop a superior herd of general-purpose cattle is determined by the following three factors: <BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<ol>
<li> Level of genetic merit in the producer's foundation cattle
<li> The producer's level of selection intensity
<li> How well the producer adheres to sound beef herd management protocol.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

</ol>

<li> A superior herd of general-purpose cattle is developed on the basis of breeding the best to the best, year after year, within a closed population, and allowing temperament, reproduction, survival, and yearling weight largely determine which cattle are best.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> There are no shortcuts, technological or otherwise, to developing a herd of most suitable cattle for a low-input ranching operation.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Developing and maintaining a functionally superior herd of general-purpose cattle involves mating mature cows to breeding-age bulls that meet the following sire standards:<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<ul>

<li> Born naturally, without any help<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Out of a cow that has been a regular breeder in a multi- or single-sire herd beginning around her first birthday<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=10 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Out of a cow with a good to excellent udder<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Good to excellent on the basis of weight and visual appearance when evaluated as a yearling bull<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Optimum frame score, reflective of a bull that can sire herd replacements best adapted to the rancher's respective ranching environment.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

</ul>

<li> Most any bull when mated to enough cows will sire a few top quality calves -- a good straight-bred or cross-bred bull will sire more -- but only a top-quality bull that has  generations of closed herd breeding and rigid, objective selection behind him from both the sire and dam side of his pedigree will sire the most.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> When selecting sires, close attention should be paid to bulls with above average yearling weights. (Lasater Ranch, Matheson Colorado)<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Exposing virgin heifers to lightweight bulls that sire calves with low birth weight minimizes the chance of permanently injuring yearling heifers at mating time, and minimizes the chance of having calving problems with first-calf heifers.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Developing and maintaining a functionally superior herd of general-purpose cattle should be viewed as a never-ending process of extending the influence of superior animals and culling the influence of inferior animals within a closed population.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

</ol>






<p><b>Beef Cattle Marketing Concepts</b></p>

<ol>

<li> Small and medium-size ranching operations have little or no marketing power.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Small and medium-size ranching operations can begin overcoming their marketing disadvantages by organizing a local or regional marketing alliance.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> In order for a cooperative marketing arrangement to work effectively, the allied ranchers must be willing opt for a common method of ranching, follow standardized operating procedures, and employ an experienced professional to coordinate the operation of their marketing co-op.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Emphasis in beef cattle marketing needs to be directed toward optimizing financial returns from ranching through the sale of unique quality "trade-name" breeding stock and unique quality "trade-name" meat.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Terms such as Rangemaster, Range-land, and Tex-land can be used as an effective trade name for promoting the breeding and marketing of highly valued breeding stock, as well as the marketing and consumption of highly valued meat.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Selecting when and which bulls to turn-out with the rancher's herd is the first step in a sound beef cattle marketing program.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Only animals that meet minimum performance standards for their contemporary group should be selected for marketing as breeding stock.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Animals that fail to meet minimum performance standards for their contemporary group should be removed from the herd and marketed as meat, never as breeding stock.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> To be reputation building, grassfed beef must be tasty, tender, uniform in quality, and free of additives proven by scientific research or perceived by consumers as being unhealthy.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> The highest valued grassfed beef in the world is produced out of cattle that have reached sexual maturity and are no longer growing addition carcass, and out of cattle that are born, grown-out, and finished on native range.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> New technological breakthroughs such as precision flake cutting makes it possible to improve the market value of meat out of cull bulls and cows slaughtered straight-off grass.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>  


</ol>







<p><b>Range Management Concepts</b></p>

<ol>

<li> Sound range management is the cornerstone of a sustainable ranching system.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The primary objective of range management is to manipulate the grazing of large herbivores so both plant and animal production can be maintained or increased.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Projecting the long-term carrying capacity of the rancher's native grazing land is the first step in a sound range management program.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Five essential practices in sound range management are:<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<ol>

<li> Keeping stocking rates 30 to 40% below projected long-term  carrying capacity;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Keeping cattle bunched together while they are grazing (rather than allowing them to spread out over the range), and never allowing cattle to linger around their preferred grazing areas (Be sure to keep cattle moving so they can't spot-overgraze the ranch's grazing land);<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 
 
<li> Minimizing lingering time around watering points and riparian areas.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Never allowing cattle to re-graze a particular range area until it has fully recovered from the previous grazing period;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Giving key forage species a chance to product a seed crop, especially on years following a long extended drought.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

</ol>

<li> The stocking rate of rangeland should never exceed 60 to 70% of its projected long-term carrying capacity.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> When stocking rates are figured on the basis of annual forage production, desert rangelands should be stocked for 10 to 15% usage of key forage species, short-grass rangelands for 20 to 25% usage, mid-grass rangelands for 30 to 35% usage, and tall-grass rangelands for 40 to 45% usage.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Loss of range forage because of grazing, browsing, trampling, rodent and insect damage, prescribed burns, wild fires,  and drought must be taken into consideration when determining the stocking rates.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> If a drought lasts long enough, a light stocking rate can become an extremely heavy stocking rate.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Developing programs that offer ranchers an opportunity to financially benefit from managing their grazing land for ecological purposes plays an important role in making sound range management ecologically viable.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> The root cause for overstocking and overgrazing is ranchers overloading their grazing land with grazers and browsers in an attempt to improve the profitability of their operations.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<li> Overstocking is a function of numbers and overgrazing is a function of both numbers and time.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>
