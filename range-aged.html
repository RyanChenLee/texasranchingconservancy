<p>Range-aged beef refers to a type of beef that is produced out of solar powered cattle that have reached physical maturity and are no longer growing additional carcass, and out of cattle that are born, grown-out, and fattened on native range grasses and forbs.  The beef is produced without the use of either chemical fertilizers, aquifer depleting irrigation, or fossil-fuel powered machinery.  Moreover, the beef is not contaminated with industrial additives which have been proven by scientific research or perceived by the public as being unhealthy.</p>

<p>Range-aged beef is sometimes referred to as range-raised beef, rangefed or range-fat beef, native grassfed beef, range-favored beef, or cowboy beef.</P> 

<p>When compared to grainfed "white-fat" beef (i.e., beef produced and finished in feedlots with corn, milo, and other industrial feedstuffs), range-aged "yellow-fat" beef contains<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=10 BORDER=0><BR>
