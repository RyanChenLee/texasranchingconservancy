Old-time aged beef was out of cattle that were born, raised, and finished (fattened) on grass, and was never grainfed.  Most old-time aged beef was produced out of either straight-bred and crossbred Texas Longhorn, Cracker, Hereford, Shorthorn, Angus, Jersey, and a few other breeds of cattle.</p> 

<p><b><u>Aged beef</u> (modern-day definition)</b> - Refers to beef that -- after slaughter and prior to processing -- has been held in storage for 10 to 30 or more days at a planned temperature and humidity.
