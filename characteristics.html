<p>Presented here is a list of operational characteristics that Nol has compiled over the years while working, managing, and consulting on different ranches and cattle operations.  He believes that when all the characteristics are combined together, they form the basis of a sustainable ranch, or in other words, the basis of an ideal community.</p>     

<p>The list is separated into three groups: 1) operational characteristics, 2) ecological characteristics, and 3) social characteristics.</p>
