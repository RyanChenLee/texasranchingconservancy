<p>The following are five important points that visitors need to know about this website:</p>

<p><u>Point 1</u> - This site's primary focus is on preserving our state's, our country's old-time ranching heritage, culture and pastoral way of life for the benefit of future generations.</p>   

<p><u>Point 2</u> - This site sets-forth many generations of story-telling by family, friends, acquaintances, and numerous others; many years of experience and observation in the field of rangeland ranching; and many years of trial and error experimentation, re-valuation, and correction as an independent rancher, ranch manager, and beef cattle consultant.</p> 

<p><u>Point 3</u> -  This site starts-off by telling a story about traditional rangeland ranching problems and mistakes, and ends-up by providing a recommended plan of action and supportive information for correcting them.</p> 
     
<p><u>Point 4</u> - Other information presented at this site includes:

<ul>
