<b><p>Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,</p></b></font>

<blockquote>

<p>Have you been observant of what people have done and are continuing to do to the agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands of North America... to all that's natural... to that which provides us with healthy food,  natural fiber, clean fresh water, clean air, and other goods and services needed for human survival? Sitting on the fence on this issue is as dangerous as Mr. Dumpty's seat on the wall. <b><i>Please let me know you really care!</i></b></p><br>

</blockquote>

<font face="Arial">

<b><p>Humpty Dumpty had a great Fall,</p></b></font>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you realize people have severely degraded and fragmented large areas of North America's grass-dominated rangelands and depleted their natural resources -- fertile soil, underground water, native vegetation, and native wildlife.  Do you realize that every day thousands of acres of what's left are lost because of suicidal farming and grazing practices...  because of uncontrolled human activities and development... because of uncontrolled urban sprawl?  Are you cognizant of the fact that everyday people are using more water and destroying more oxygen producing and carbon reducing vegetation than "Mother Nature" is capable of replacing?  How about the fact that everyday people are polluting our water and air supply with more harmful chemicals than our planet's grass-dominated rangelands and other planetary ecosystems are capable of removing?  <b><i>Please let me know you really care!</i></b></p><br>

</blockquote>

<p><b>All the King's horses and all the King's men,</b></p>
<font face="Arial">
</font>

<blockquote>

<p>Please tell me who is going to recreate all the grass-dominated rangelands and natural rangeland resources people have destroyed since the discovery of North America, since the beginning of recorded history?   How can we expect to continue seeing abundant food at the grocery store and in our homes... enough clean water to drink... and enough clean air to breathe when people can't or won't recognize and acknowledge the necessity for protecting the planetary ecosystems and natural resources that provide us with such abundant bounty... when people can't or won't recognize the importance for protecting the life-support system that "Mother Nature" has provided us for sustaining human life? <b><i>Please let me know you really care!</i></b></p><br>

</blockquote>

<font face="Arial">
<p><b>Couldn't put Humpty together again!</b></p>
</font>

<blockquote>

<p>Sooner or later the time will come when our descendants will begin suffering the consequences of what past and present generations of people have and are continuing to do to the agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands of North America."  When that day comes, do you think they will consider our "improvements" to the natural world... our natural resource degrading and rangeland fragmenting behavior worth their having to cope with poverty, thirst, and unbreathable air?  Do you think they will consider our economic progress and "modifications" to the life-supporting rangelands of North America... of "Mother Earth"... to all that is natural worth their being condemned to a never ending life of fighting for existence?  <b><i>Please let me know you really care!</i></b></p><br> 

</blockquote>

<p>In closing, please keep in mind that my <i><b>please do you really care question</b></i> applies to all people living on the plains and prairies of North American... which includes all people living in Mexico, United States, and Canada.  The question should also apply to all people living on the pampas and other grassland regions in central and south America.</p><br>
