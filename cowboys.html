<p> It should be noted that the following characteristics have been noticed over the years, and are common with the working cowboys that I've known and worked with:</p> 

<ul>

<li> Like simplicity and tranquility in their everyday lives.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br>

<li> Have problems finding and keeping wives that are willing to stay with them and be happy living their simple way of life.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Very appreciative of the natural surroundings around them.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br>   

<li> Enjoy their freedom and are very protective of it.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Prefer staying away from large crowds and cites.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Dislikes people that don't show respect for  themselves, their peers, elders, or  women, and that mistreat kids.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Like being a cowboy because of the work, lifestyle and purpose, not because of the pay.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br>  

<li> Know how to ride a horse, throw a good loop, and handle all types of livestock, no matter how wild, mean, or docile.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Most prized possessions are a good trained horse and stock dog, a good hand-made saddle, a good dallying rope, their chaps, their boots, their hat, and a scarf to tie around their neck.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 

<li> Treat their pet dog like he or she is their best friend.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br> 
  
<li> Like sitting around the dinner table or campfire drinking coffee and chewing the fat with family, friends, and acquaintances.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br>

<li> Believe that good full-time cowboy work is getting harder and harder to find, and in time will probably disappear all together.<br><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></br>
