<p>The term old-time working ranches refers to the original type ranches that were founded in Texas and other U.S. range states and regions between 1850s and 1870s.  Principle activities of these founding ranches were centered around raising cattle, sheep, goats, and horses, and doing so for the purpose of either retaining, bartering, or marketing them as breeding stock, work animals, meat, leather, wool, mohair, as well as other related products. Old-time working ranches are important because they served and continue to serve as a home-place for western ranchers, working cowboys, chuck-wagon cooks, and ranch family members.  They are also important because they played a major role in the formation of our state's, our country's rangeland ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life.</p>


<p>Many old-time working ranches were famous for having thousands of acres of grazing land and for having large herds of cattle, as well as other types of livestock.  In most cases, they were managed by professional ranch managers with plenty of herd management and livestock handling experience.  Trained cowboys on horseback were used to provide daily care for their livestock. Their grazing land served as the home-place for many types of native range grasses and forbs, as well as many types of range-dependent wildlife species.</p> 

<p>Preservation of old-time working ranches is important because, when properly managed, they can play a vital role in providing a variety of life-supporting (sustaining) goods and services for the benefit of society.  And, when properly managed, they can serve as responsible stewards for our state's, our country's native rangeland resources -- soil, water, vegetation, and wildlife.</p>
