<p>Our group's recommended plan of action for accomplishing our mission is centered around encouraging working ranchers in Texas and other range states and regions to incorporate the following <u>initiatives</u> in their respective ranching approach:</p>

<ul>

<li> Opting for a METHOD OF RANCHING that's financially viable, ecologically responsible, and <a name="terms">socially</a> acceptable, and can be maintained over an indefinite period of time without degrading and fragmenting our country's agriculturally and ecologically important rangelands;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>  

<li> Organizing a WORKING RANCHERS ASSOCIATION for the purpose of strengthening the  procurement, marketing, and political power of associated members, and consequently offering them an opportunity to strengthen their financial, ecological, and social position in the ranching business;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>   

<li> Establishing a RANGE-AGED BEEF COUNCIL for the purpose of doing the following work:<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

<ul> 

<li> Promoting the <u>marketing</u> of range-aged beef out of cattle that are physically mature and are no longer growing additional carcass, and out of cattle that are born, grown-out, and fattened on native range;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR> 

<li> Promoting the <u>benefits</u> of range-aged beef to health-conscious consumers;<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0><BR>

</ul>  

<li> Enlisting the use of a REGISTERED TRADE NAME -- such as Rangeland, Texland,  Rangemaster, Forager, etc. -- for promoting the production and marketing of range-adapted breeding stock and range-aged beef.<BR><IMG SRC="pictures/dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=1 BORDER=0><BR>

</ul>

<p>We feel certain that how well each of the above initiatives are carried-out by full-time working ranchers, as individuals and groups, could determine the fate of our state's, our country's old-time ranching heritage, culture, and pastoral way of life.</p>

<p>Our group is open to suggestions concerning changes or additions to the above plan. All you need to do is give us a holler!</p>
